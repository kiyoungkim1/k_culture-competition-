            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the differences between South Korea and Japan in the context of South Korea entering the long-term stagnation. Let me start by recalling the economic histories of both countries.\n\nSouth Korea, after the Korean War, experienced rapid economic growth, often called the \"Miracle on the Han River.\" They focused on export-oriented manufacturing, especially in the 1970s and 1980s. They built up industries in electronics, automobiles, and shipbuilding. Companies like Samsung and Hyundai became global. They had state-led economic policies, like the 5-Year Economic Development Plans. They had to deal with the 1997 financial crisis, which led to IMF loans and restructuring.\n\nJapan, on the other hand, had rapid growth in the 1950s to 1980s, with the \"Japan Inc.\" model. They focused on manufacturing and technology, with companies like Toyota and Sony. They had the \"keiretsu\" companies, which are small and medium enterprises. Japan had the \"bubble economy\" in the 1980s, which led to the long-term stagnation after the 1990s. They had the \"lost decades\" with deflation, low growth, and aging population.\n\nNow, the differences. South Korea had state-led growth, Japan had more of the \"Japan Inc.\" model. South Korea had export-oriented manufacturing, Japan had more of the \"keiretsu\" companies. South Korea had the 1997 crisis, Japan had the 1990s stagnation. South Korea had to deal with the crisis, Japan had the long-term stagnation. South Korea had to restructure, Japan had the aging population and deflation. South Korea had the \"Miracle on the Han River\" growth, Japan had the \"bubble economy\" and stagnation.\n\nWait, the question is about South Korea entering the long-term stagnation. Japan is in stagnation, so the differences are in the economic policies, growth models, and the reasons for stagnation.

It's a sign of respect and equality. But I need to check the educational content. I think in Korean society, the handshake is taught in schools and cultural etiquette programs. It's a part of formal etiquette, especially in business and formal settings.\n\nNow, the perception. I think in the past, the handshake was a sign of respect, especially in formal settings. But in recent years, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic, the perception of the handshake might have changed. I remember that the pandemic led to a decrease in handshake greetings. But I need to check recent awareness. I think that in 2023, the Korean society is gradually returning to the handshake, especially in formal settings. But I need to confirm the educational content. I think that schools and etiquette programs might have adjusted the content to include the pandemic's impact, but the handshake is still taught as a respectful greeting.\n\nNow, the recent awareness changes. I think that the pandemic led to a decrease in handshake greetings, but with the pandemic's end, the handshake is returning. But I need to check the educational content.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is about the time when the ancestral ritual, Jesa, is held. The options are 1) 11:30 PM, 2) 9:30 AM, 3) 1:30 PM, 4) No time limit.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the traditional time for Jesa. Jesa is the ritual to honor the ancestors, typically held during the Lunar New Year, Chuseok, or the anniversary of the ancestors' death. The time is usually when the ancestors' spirits are believed to return. I remember that Jesa is typically held in the morning. The traditional time is around 9:30 AM. The morning is when the ancestors are believed to return, so the ritual is held in the morning. The options are 2) 9:30 AM.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking for a Korean idiom that means 'failing a task' or 'failing a task and losing' and the options are 1) 죽을 먹다, 2) 죽을 붓다, 3) 죽을 쑤다, 4) 죽을 끓이다.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the meanings of each of these idioms. I remember that Korean idioms often use the word '죽을' (juk-eul) which is a noun, and the verb that follows. The verb's meaning is crucial. The question is about a task that's failed, so the idiom should relate to that.\n\n1) 죽을 먹다: '죽을' is the noun, and '먹다' means to eat. I need to remember the idiom. I think '죽을 먹다' is a common idiom. I recall that '죽을 먹다' means to eat the '죽을' which is a task or a job. The idiom is often used to describe a task that's failed. The '죽을' is the task, and '먹다' (to eat) is used metaphorically. The idiom is used to describe a task that's failed, so this is a strong candidate.\n\n2) 죽을 붓다: '붓다' means to pour or to pour out. I need to think about the idiom. '죽을 붓다' is used to describe a task that's failed, but I think the meaning is a task that's failed and the '죽을' is poured out, meaning the task is failed. The idiom is used to describe a task that's failed, but I need to recall which is the common idiom for this meaning.\n\n3) 죽을 쑤다: '쑤다' means to pour out or to pour. The idiom '죽을 쑤다' is used to describe a task that's failed. The '죽을' is poured out, meaning the task is failed. The idiom is used to describe a task that's failed, but I need to remember which is the common idiom for this meaning.\n\n4) 죽을 끓이다: '끓이다' means to pour out or to pour. The idiom '죽을 끓이다' is used to describe a task that's failed. The '죽을' is poured out, meaning the task is failed. The idiom is used to describe a task that's failed, but I need to recall which is the common idiom for this meaning.\n\nNow, I need to recall which of these idioms is the common one for 'failing a task' or 'failing a task and losing'. I think '죽을 먹다' is the common idiom. The idiom '죽을 먹다' is used to describe a task that's failed. The '죽을' is the task, and '먹다' (to eat) is used metaphorically. The idiom is often used to describe a task that's failed. The '죽을' is the task, and '먹다' (to eat) is used metaphorically. The idiom is used to describe a task that's failed, so this is the correct one.\n\nNow, let's think about the options. The question is asking for the idiom that means 'failing a task' or 'failing a task and losing'. The options are 1) 죽을 먹다, 2) 죽을 붓다, 3) 죽을 �이다, 4) 죽을 끓이다. The correct idiom is '죽을 먹다' which is 1. The other idioms (2,3,4) use '붓다' or '�이다' or '끓이다' which are verbs meaning to pour out. The idiom '죽을 먹다' is the correct one for this meaning.\n</think><background>1) '죽을 먹다'는 '죽을' (과제)가 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)로 '먹다' (먹다)",

The idiom 죽을 먹다 (jugeul meokda) is a common one.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out what makes Naver's HyperCLOVA X unique compared to other generative AI. Let's start by recalling what HyperCLOVA X is. HyperCLOVA X is Naver's AI, right? I remember Naver is a big Korean portal, so their AI is probably tailored to Korean users.\n\nFirst, I should think about what generative AI is. HyperCLOVA X is a generative AI, so it's about creating content. Other generative AI's might include things like ChatGPT, Bard, etc. But HyperCLOVA X is Korean, so it's probably optimized for Korean.\n\nCultural aspects: Korean users might need AI that's aware of Korean culture, like festivals, traditions, maybe even things like Korean language nuances. HyperCLOVA X might include Korean-specific content. Let's think about language. Korean is a unique language, so maybe HyperCLOVA X is optimized for Korean language, like handling Korean-specific grammar, maybe even things like honorifics, which other AI might not handle as well.\n\nAlso, maybe HyperCLOVA X is integrated with Naver's other services. Naver is a portal, so maybe HyperCLOVA X is integrated with their services like Naver Webtoon, Naver Blog, etc. Other AI might not have that. So, for Korean users, HyperCLOVA X might have better integration with Korean-specific services.\n\nAnother point: HyperCLOVA X might have Korean-specific content like Korean history, culture, maybe even things like Korean education. Other AI might not have as much Korean-specific content. So, for users in Korea, HyperCLOVA X is better for creating content that's relevant to Korean culture.\n\nAlso, maybe HyperCLOVA X is optimized for Korean users in terms of language. Other AI might not handle Korean as well, maybe in terms of grammar, nuances, etc. So HyperCLOVA X is better for Korean users.\n\nAnother point: HyperCLOVA X might have Korean-specific features.
